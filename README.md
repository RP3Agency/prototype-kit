# RP3's Prototype Build Kit

This is our opinion of what you need to start prototyping in code.  We've pre-configured SCSS, HTML Extender, EJS, Markdown rendering, BrowserSync and more.

## Getting started

1. Open `gulpfile.js` in a text editor of your choice and set all the config options marked with a `//TODO:`
2. `npm install`
3. `gulp`
4. Start making things!
