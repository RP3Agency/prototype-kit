# Image guidelines:

- Use SVG, and build into components whenever feasible.
- Avoid Icon Fonts in production code.
- Separate decorative images and content images into their own folders, and
	 make folders to logically group content images.
	- For example, create a folder to hold any images that would be content
		managed on a given page ("aboutUsImages").
	- Categorize reusable images in their own folders
		(icons, logos, textures, etc)
- Use camel case, we're not writing PHP here. (no underscores in file names
	please, it looks trashy.)
